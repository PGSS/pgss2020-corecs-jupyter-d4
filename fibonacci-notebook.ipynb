    "To solve any problem in programming, it is *always* recommended to start with a simple version of one's true problem, to make sure that one's understanding of the environment and problem itself is basically correct. The end of this Notebook will be a challenge to create a program to calculate a value that *could* be calculated by hand but would take quite a long time to do so. The grand problem is to calculate the 100th value of [the Fibonacci Sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number), but we will start by illustrating the use of a `for` loop on a simpler problem: the summation of the integers from 1 to 4, inclusive."
