    "To solve any problem in programming, it is *always* recommended to start with a simple version of one's true problem, to make sure that one's understanding of the environment and problem itself is basically correct. The end of this Notebook will be a challenge to create a program to calculate a value that *could* be calculated by hand but would take quite a long time to do so. The grand problem is to calculate the 100th value of [the Fibonacci Sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number), but we will start by illustrating the use of a `for` loop on a simpler problem: the summation of the integers from 1 to 4, inclusive."

    "The new programming element in the code above is the List. How a given Python program handles lists are what make that code truly Pythonic, or just code that happens to be written Python. Python is very list-centric and it has many shorthand ways of handling lists. For me, I like how it simplifies the concept of `for` loops. It easy to visualize how the code indented under the line with `for` in it is applied 4 times to 1, 2, 3 and 4. However, manually typing out `[1, 2, 3, 4]` is better than manually calculating most things, but it turns out there is a way to easily generate those lists of sequential numbers..."
